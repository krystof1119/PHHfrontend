# PHHfrontend
The frontend for my PHH (programmer humor hackathon) submission. Look away, the code and functionality hurts.

For example:

* There are no devDependencies. All deps go to dependencies
* There are like 50 different frontend libraries
* It uses jquery

**WARNING**

This repository is really bad. If you look at it 
for too long, you may exhibit the following symptoms

* Thinking frontend developers are competent
* Liking PHP
* Programming in HTML
* Creating AI out of case structures instead of if structures
* Trying to not use google while programming
* Bringing down stackoverflow for revenge (please don't do this though)
* Using light mode when dark mode is an option
* Removing dark mode from the IDE you maintain
* Using languages where arrays start at 1
* Having your code compile
* Coding without CTRL-C, CTRL-V and CTRL-Z

Still want to run this code? Alright, here's the instructions.

1. Download this code (probably with GIT but whatever counts)
2. Deploy (or run) the backend code
3. Put the backend address into src/config.ts
4. `yarn install`
5. `yarn run build`
6. Open dist/index.html in your browser
